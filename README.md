### Parts (Please make sure these are the right parts before you get them.)
1.  SparkFun PID 15423 Qwiic Micro - SAMD21 Development Board
2.  Adafruit 9-DOF Orientation IMU Fusion Breakout - BNO085 (BNO080) - STEMMA QT / Qwiic
3.  SparkFun Qwiic Button - Green LED - BOB-16842
4.  SparkFun Qwiic LED Stick APA102C
5.  Battery Holder 3xAA with Cover and Switch - Bare Wire
6.  Spray paint, or another type of paint, if you want to change the color of the battery holder
7.  A way to connect the wires from the battery holder to the Development Board.  (I cut something that plugged into a wall, which had black and red insulators inside.)
8.  SparkFun Qwiic Cables
9.  Stick on Velcro (If the rough side lasts longer, you might want to attach the electrical parts to the rough side, instead of the softer side.)
